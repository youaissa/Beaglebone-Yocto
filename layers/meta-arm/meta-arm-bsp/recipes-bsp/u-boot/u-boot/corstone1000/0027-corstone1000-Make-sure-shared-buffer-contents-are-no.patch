Subject: [PATCH 08/10] corstone1000: Make sure shared buffer contents are not
 cached

After updating the shared buffer, it is required to flush the cache
to ensure that the secure world sees expected the shared buffer
contents.

The MM communication shared buffer is configured in device region of optee
which has cache disabled. So we need to invalidate the cache every time we
update the buffer on uboot otherwise the secure world does not see the
accurate values.
