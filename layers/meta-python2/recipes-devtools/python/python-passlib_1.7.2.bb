SUMMARY = "comprehensive password hashing framework supporting over 30 schemes"
DESCRIPTION = "\
Passlib is a password hashing library for Python 2 & 3, which provides cross-platform \
implementations of over 30 password hashing algorithms, as well as a framework for \
managing existing password hashes. It’s designed to be useful for a wide range of \
tasks, from verifying a hash found in /etc/shadow, to providing full-strength password \
hashing for multi-user applications."
